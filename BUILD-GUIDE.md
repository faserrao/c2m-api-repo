## What This Project Does

The C2M API project creates documentation and testing tools for a mail processing service. Think of it like building an instruction manual that:
- Explains how to use the mail API
- Creates testing tools to verify everything works
- Publishes everything online for easy access

The build process takes source files and transforms them into:
1. **API Documentation** - Like a user manual for developers
2. **Testing Collections** - Automated tests to verify the API works
3. **Mock Servers** - Practice servers for testing without sending real mail

## Two Ways to Build

You have two options for building this project:

### üåê **Option 1: GitHub (Easiest)**
Let GitHub's servers do all the work for you. No software installation needed!

### üíª **Option 2: Local Build**
Build on your own computer. Requires some software installation but gives you more control.

4. Leave all options as default
5. Click the green **Run workflow** button

#### 5. Monitor Progress
1. Refresh the page after a few seconds
2. Click on the running workflow to watch progress
3. Green checkmarks = success!
4. Red X = something went wrong (see Troubleshooting)

#### 6. View Results
- **Documentation**: Check the GitHub Pages URL (usually `https://[username].github.io/c2m-api-repo`)
- **Postman**: Log into Postman and check your workspace for new collections

## Option 2: Local Build

### Prerequisites

You'll need to install some software first. Don't worry - we'll guide you through it!

#### For Mac Users

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   ```
   brew install git node python make jq
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```
   git --version
   node --version
   python3 --version
   make --version
   ```
   
   Each command should show a version number.

#### For Windows Users

1. **Install Git**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. **Install Node.js**: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
3. **Install Python**: Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
4. **Install Make**: Use Git Bash (installed with Git) which includes make

### Step-by-Step Build Instructions

#### 1. Get the Code
1. Open Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows)
2. Navigate to where you want to save the project:
   ```
   cd ~/Documents
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/c2m-api-repo.git
   cd c2m-api-repo
   ```

#### 2. Set Up Environment
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with a text editor and add:
   ```
   POSTMAN_SERRAO_API_KEY=your-postman-api-key-here
   ```
   (Replace with your actual Postman API key from earlier)

#### 3. Install Dependencies
Run this command to install everything needed:
```
make install
```

This will:
- Install Node.js packages
- Set up Python environment
- Download required tools

#### 4. Run the Build
Now for the main event! Run:
```
make postman-collection-build-and-test
```

This single command will:
1. Convert data files to API specifications
2. Generate testing collections
3. Create mock servers
4. Run automated tests
5. Build documentation

#### 5. View Results
- **Documentation**: Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
- **Test Results**: Check the terminal output for test summaries

## Understanding the Output

### What Success Looks Like

When the build succeeds, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks in GitHub Actions
- ‚úÖ "All tests passed" messages
- ‚úÖ New collections in your Postman workspace
- ‚úÖ Documentation available online

### What Gets Created

1. **OpenAPI Specification**
   - Technical description of the API
   - Located in `openapi/` folder

2. **Postman Collections**
   - Testing tools for the API
   - Automatically uploaded to your Postman workspace

3. **Documentation Website**
   - User-friendly API documentation
   - Published to GitHub Pages or viewable locally

4. **Mock Servers**
   - Practice servers for testing
   - No real mail is sent!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Command not found"
**Problem**: Missing required software
**Solution**: Go back to Prerequisites and install missing tools

#### "Permission denied"
**Problem**: No access to files or API
**Solution**: 
- Check file permissions
- Verify your Postman API key is correct
- Ensure you have repository access

#### "Postman API error"
**Problem**: Can't connect to Postman
**Solution**:
- Check your API key in `.env` file
- Ensure no extra spaces after the key
- Verify your Postman account is active

#### "Port already in use"
**Problem**: Another program is using port 4010 or 8080
**Solution**:
- Stop other development servers
- Or change ports in `.env` file

#### Build Fails in GitHub Actions
**Problem**: Red X on workflow run
**Solution**:
1. Click on the failed run
2. Click on the failed step
3. Read the error message
4. Common fixes:
   - Check API key is set correctly
   - Ensure `.postman-target` file exists
   - Verify repository settings

### Quick Fixes

#### Clean Everything and Start Fresh
```
make clean
make install
make postman-collection-build-and-test
```

#### Just Build Documentation
```
make docs
```

#### Just Run Tests
```
make test
```
