These are either duplicates or overly granular:

postman-collection-fix and postman-collection-fix-merged

Their only job is adding an info block, which you can roll into postman-collection-generate or handle once before merging.

postman-collection-url-normalize, postman-collection-url-repair, postman-collection-url-hardfix

You only need one URL repair/normalization step (keep postman-collection-url-fix or rename it).

postman-collection-build-debug

This is verbose and likely unnecessary unless you constantly debug the raw JSON.

postman-collection-build-test

This pipeline is a variant of your main build. It’s cleaner to keep one postman-collection-build and run postman-collection-upload-test separately if needed.

postman-collection-fix-paths

If the url_hardfix.jq script correctly builds the paths, you don’t need a separate target for this.




2. Targets to Keep (Core Build Flow)
The core Postman collection build should be:

postman-collection-generate

postman-collection-merge-overrides

postman-collection-add-examples

postman-collection-add-tests

postman-collection-auto-fix

postman-collection-url-fix

postman-collection-validate

This makes postman-collection-build your one-stop target.



3. Consolidation Recommendations
Combine postman-collection-fix and postman-collection-fix-merged into the first step of postman-collection-generate (add the info block there).

Use url_hardfix.jq as your single source of truth for URL normalization—rename postman-collection-url-hardfix to postman-collection-url-fix and drop the rest.

Integrate fix_paths.jq into url_hardfix.jq (if they overlap), avoiding multiple passes of jq.
