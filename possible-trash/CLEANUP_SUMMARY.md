# Cleanup Summary

## Total Space Recovered: ~65.2 GB

### Major Findings:

#### 1. **Massive Screen Recording (65 GB)**
- File: `Old/test-images/Screen Recording 2025-08-23 at 3.11.41 PM.mov`
- This single file accounts for 99.7% of the space
- Likely a development/debugging recording that was accidentally committed

#### 2. **Old Directories (65 GB total)**
- `Old/` - Contains the massive screen recording and old backups
- `postman/generated/Old/` - Old Postman collections (1.5 MB)
- `openapi/Old/` - Old OpenAPI specs (100 KB)
- `DocumentationAndNotes/c2m_todo/ScriptsStuff/Old/` - Old scripts (17 MB)

#### 3. **Python Cache (13 MB)**
- `__pycache__` directories throughout the project
- `.pyc` compiled Python files
- Can be regenerated automatically

#### 4. **Other Notable Items:**
- Debug JSON files (12 KB)
- Tracking text files (48 KB)
- Backup files (.bak, .old) (56 KB)
- Build artifacts in gen/ (296 KB)
- Test spec files (40 KB)
- macOS .DS_Store files (280 KB)

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action**: Delete the 65GB screen recording file
   ```bash
   rm -f "possible-trash/old-directories/Old/test-images/Screen Recording 2025-08-23 at 3.11.41 PM.mov"
   ```

2. **Review Before Deleting**:
   - Check if any files in `Old/docs.bak/` are needed (26 MB)
   - Verify tracking files aren't actively used
   - Ensure no important code in old directories

3. **Add to .gitignore**:
   ```
   # Large media files
   *.mov
   *.mp4
   *.avi
   
   # Screen recordings
   Screen Recording*
   
   # Old directories
   Old/
   */Old/
   
   # Python cache
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   
   # Debug files
   *debug*.json
   
   # Backup files
   *.bak
   *.old
   ```

4. **Git Cleanup** (if these were committed):
   ```bash
   # Remove large files from git history
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
     'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch "*.mov"' \
     --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

### Space Usage by Category:
- Old directories: 65 GB (99.7%)
- Python cache: 13 MB (0.02%)
- All other categories: < 5 MB combined

### Total Files Moved:
- ~100+ individual files
- 4 complete directories
- Various tracking and temporary files

The cleanup operation was successful in identifying and organizing deletable files, with the most significant finding being the 65GB screen recording that should definitely be removed from the repository.
