⏺ Summary

  I've successfully added two new JWT authentication endpoints to the C2M API:

  1. POST /auth/token - Get Short-term JWT Token

  - Purpose: Obtain a short-lived JWT access token for API authentication
  - Request: Requires a refresh token and optional scopes
  - Response: Returns access token, token type, expiration time, and granted scopes

  2. POST /auth/refresh-token - Get Long-term Refresh Token

  - Purpose: Obtain a long-lived refresh token for requesting short-term tokens
  - Request: Requires API key, API secret, optional client ID and scopes
  - Response: Returns refresh token, token type, expiration time, and granted scopes

  The endpoints have been:
  - Added to the EBNF data dictionary with proper syntax
  - Generated in the OpenAPI specification
  - Fixed to use proper type definitions
  - Validated successfully with both Redocly and Spectral linters

  The authentication flow follows standard JWT patterns where users first obtain a long-term refresh token using their API credentials,
  then use that refresh token to get short-term access tokens for API requests.

> So with respect to the JWT additions, does the dd to openapi translator put the openapi spec in a state that is ready to be uploaded to 
  Postman or does more info get added beforehand

⏺ Good question! Let me examine the current state of the generated OpenAPI spec and check what additional information might be needed
  before uploading to Postman.

⏺ Task(Analyze OpenAPI completeness)
  ⎿  Done (30 tool uses · 43.2k tokens · 5m 14.2s)                                                                                         

⏺ Based on my analysis, the EBNF-to-OpenAPI translator generates a minimal but valid OpenAPI spec. However, for the JWT endpoints to be
  production-ready and useful in Postman, several enhancements are needed:

  Current State

  The translator creates:
  - ✅ Basic endpoint structure
  - ✅ Request/response schemas
  - ✅ Field types and descriptions (from EBNF comments)
  - ✅ Required field validations

  What's Missing

  - ❌ Example values - Critical for Postman testing
  - ❌ Detailed field descriptions - Current ones are too brief
  - ❌ Error response schemas - Only status codes, no error body structure
  - ❌ Security overrides - Auth endpoints shouldn't require Bearer tokens
  - ❌ Enum constraints - e.g., tokenType should be enum: ["Bearer"]

  Recommended Enhancements

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Add example values to JWT endpoints in OpenAPI spec
     ☐ Define error response schemas for auth endpoints
     ☐ Override security requirements for auth endpoints
     ☐ Add proper constraints and enums to token fields

⏺ Would you like me to:
  1. Add these enhancements directly to make the spec Postman-ready?
  2. Create a post-processing script that automatically enhances auth endpoints after EBNF conversion?
  3. Update the EBNF with more detailed information that would generate a richer OpenAPI spec?

  The typical workflow seems to be that the EBNF-to-OpenAPI conversion provides the skeleton, and then additional scripts or manual edits
  add the production-ready details before uploading to Postman.

> Can you please document everything you did to include the JWT functionality in the repo.  Every file modified and how it was modified.

  Overview

  Added two new JWT authentication endpoints to the C2M API for access control purposes:
  1. POST /auth/token - Get short-term JWT access token
  2. POST /auth/refresh-token - Get long-term refresh token

  Files Modified

  1. data_dictionary/c2mapiv2-dd.ebnf

  Added JWT authentication endpoint definitions after the existing use cases (lines 150-197):

  Added Use Case 10:
  (*
    Use Case 10: Get a short-term JWT token for API access
    Endpoint: POST /auth/token
    Used to obtain a short-lived JWT token for authenticating API requests.
    Requires a long-term refresh token.
  *)
  getShortTermTokenParams =
        refreshToken
      + [ scopes ] ;

  refreshToken = string ;  (* Long-term JWT refresh token *)
  scopes = { scope } ;     (* Optional list of permission scopes requested *)
  scope = string ;         (* Individual permission scope *)

  Added Use Case 11:
  (*
    Use Case 11: Get a long-term refresh token
    Endpoint: POST /auth/refresh-token
    Used to obtain a long-lived refresh token that can be used to request short-term access tokens.
    Requires API credentials.
  *)
  getLongTermTokenParams =
        apiKey
      + apiSecret
      + [ clientId ]
      + [ scopes ] ;

  apiKey = string ;       (* API key provided by Click2Mail *)
  apiSecret = string ;    (* API secret provided by Click2Mail *)
  clientId = string ;     (* Optional client identifier *)

  Added Response Definitions:
  (* Response for short-term token request *)
  shortTermTokenResponse =
        accessToken
      + tokenType
      + expiresIn
      + [ issuedScopes ] ;

  accessToken = string ;   (* JWT access token for API authentication *)
  tokenType = string ;     (* Token type, typically "Bearer" *)
  expiresIn = integer ;    (* Token expiration time in seconds *)
  issuedScopes = { scope } ; (* List of granted permission scopes *)

  (* Response for long-term refresh token request *)
  longTermTokenResponse =
        refreshToken
      + tokenType
      + expiresIn
      + [ issuedScopes ] ;

  2. openapi/c2mapiv2-openapi-spec-final.yaml

  After running make ebnf-dd-to-openapi-spec, the converter generated the basic structure, but manual fixes were required:

  Fixed Schema Definitions (lines 339-396):
  Changed references from $ref: '#/components/schemas/string' to proper type definitions:
  refreshToken:
    type: string
    description: Long-term JWT refresh token

  scope:
    type: string
    description: Individual permission scope

  apiKey:
    type: string
    description: API key provided by Click2Mail

  apiSecret:
    type: string
    description: API secret provided by Click2Mail

  clientId:
    type: string
    description: Optional client identifier

  accessToken:
    type: string
    description: JWT access token for API authentication

  tokenType:
    type: string
    description: Token type, typically "Bearer"

  expiresIn:
    type: integer
    description: Token expiration time in seconds

  Updated Endpoint Responses (lines 1092 & 1125):
  Changed from StandardResponse to proper response schemas:
  - /auth/token → shortTermTokenResponse
  - /auth/refresh-token → longTermTokenResponse

  Updated Endpoint Summaries (lines 1071 & 1099):
  - Changed "Operation for /auth/token" → "Get a short-term JWT access token"
  - Changed "Operation for /auth/refresh-token" → "Get a long-term refresh token"

  Process Summary

  1. Modified EBNF Data Dictionary - Added endpoint definitions with proper EBNF syntax
  2. Regenerated OpenAPI Spec - Ran make ebnf-dd-to-openapi-spec
  3. Fixed Type References - Converter created invalid $ref to string/integer types
  4. Updated Response Schemas - Changed from generic to specific response types
  5. Enhanced Descriptions - Made endpoint summaries more descriptive

  Validation Results

  - ✅ OpenAPI spec validates successfully with Redocly and Spectral
  - ✅ All schema references resolve correctly
  - ✅ Endpoints appear in generated spec at /auth/token and /auth/refresh-token

  Notes

  - The EBNF-to-OpenAPI converter doesn't handle primitive type references well
  - Manual intervention was required to fix schema definitions
  - The endpoints are functional but could benefit from examples and enhanced documentation for Postman
