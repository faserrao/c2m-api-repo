Login to postman online and generate an api key.
Copy the api key and and it to .env in the base directory.
Add .env to .gitignore.

‚úÖ To install the Postman CLI on macOS (via Homebrew):

brew install --cask postman-cli
This installs the CLI tool used in your Makefile (not the GUI Postman app).

üîç After installing, verify it's working:

postman --version
You should see something like:

Postman CLI version x.y.z
‚úÖ Then log in interactively:

postman login
This will:

Open a browser to authenticate

Link your CLI to your Postman account

Store credentials in ~/.postman

Once logged in, you no longer need to supply POSTMAN_API_KEY manually when running your Makefile.

Let me know once you've done this and I can show how to skip the key for future runs.
