# Typical spec-to-postman workflow

runs-on: ubuntu-latest
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # install openapi-to-postman if needed
  - run: npm install -g @apideck/openapi-to-postman

  # convert the spec
  - run: openapi2postmanv2 -s openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml \
                           -o postman/Click2Mail.postman_collection.json \
                           -p \
                           --pretty

  # Option A ‚Äì store as a build artifact
  - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    with:
      name: postman-collection
      path: postman/Click2Mail.postman_collection.json

  # Option B ‚Äì push to a separate branch (e.g. postman-artifacts)
  #   similar to gh-pages pattern


So it only reads your spec and produces a JSON Postman collection. It doesn‚Äôt touch docs or run linters.

2. Do you need to merge them?

No. You can drop the new file beside the other three‚ÄîGitHub will just run a fourth job whenever its on: trigger fires.

A merge / consolidation is only worthwhile if you prefer fewer YAML files or want a single ‚ÄúAPI CI‚Äù workflow matrix.

Minimal friction plan

Keep the three working files unchanged.

Add spec-to-postman.yml with a distinct name and its own triggers (push to main, PRs, or workflow_dispatch only).

Verify it succeeds. If you like the output path (artifact vs branch), leave it.

Nothing else breaks.

3. Optional clean-up / consolidation ideas

A. Split build output from source
Your current Build Redoc and Deploy job commits docs/index.html back to main. That is what frequently diverges from local history.

Better pattern (zero force-push headaches)

Ignore docs/ in .gitignore.

Keep Redoc build in CI, but publish to gh-pages branch via peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.

You‚Äôd remove the ‚ÄúCommit and push generated docs‚Äù step and replace it with:

- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    publish_dir: docs
    publish_branch: gh-pages
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

Now main never changes just because docs rebuild. Your local pushes become simple fast-forwards.

B. Combine the two linter jobs
You could place Spectral and Redocly in the same YAML and run them in a matrix:

strategy:
  matrix:
    linter: [spectral, redocly]
steps:
  # checkout & install node once
  - run: |
      if [ "${{ matrix.linter }}" == "spectral" ]; then
        spectral lint openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
      else
        redocly lint openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
      fi

But that‚Äôs cosmetic; separate files are fine.

4. Recommended next step
Add spec-to-postman.yml verbatim (or use the example above).

Watch a push happen ‚Üí check Actions tab ‚Üí ensure a Postman collection artifact appears.

Later, decide if you want to:

Push that collection into a postman/ branch

Attach it to GitHub Releases

Or publish directly to Postman‚Äôs API via the Postman CLI.

Refactor the Redoc build to deploy to gh-pages so local git push no longer collides with bot commits.

That preserves your working pipelines and adds the Postman automation without risk.


I am confused.  This is the file that you gave me called spec-to-postman.yml:

Got it ‚Äîseeing that full spec-to-postman.yml clarifies why it looks ‚Äúoverlapping.‚Äù
Here‚Äôs what each workflow does side-by-side and how you can decide to keep, replace, or merge them without breaking anything.

Area	Your 3 existing files	spec-to-postman.yml does

Linters	File 2 ‚Üí redocly lint

File 3 ‚Üí spectral lint	Runs Spectral + openapi-diff (breaking-change check). Redocly linting is not in this new file.
Docs build	File 1 ‚Üí builds ReDoc HTML ‚ü∂ commits to main	Copies raw spec + custom HTML templates and publishes to gh-pages (only on main).
Postman / tests	none	Converts spec ‚ûù Postman collection ‚ûù merges overrides ‚ûù runs Newman tests ‚ûù uploads HTML report.
Contract testing	none	Optional Schemathesis (property-based fuzz/coverage) tests; uploads report.
Output branch	Commits docs/index.html back to main	Publishes entire docs/ folder to the gh-pages branch (safer).
Trigger	push to main, PRs	push to main, PRs; only the final deploy runs on main.

üå≥ Decision tree

1. Do you want Postman-generation & automated Newman tests?

Yes ‚Üí keep spec-to-postman.yml (or at least the Postman+Newman parts).

No ‚Üí delete or comment out the Postman/Newman/Schemathesis steps; you can still use the gh-pages deploy section if you like it.

2. Do you like publishing docs to gh-pages instead of committing HTML to main?

Yes ‚Üí you can remove or trim your old Build ReDoc and Deploy to Pages file, because spec-to-postman.yml already builds/publishes docs in a cleaner way (and solves the force-push problem).

No / not yet ‚Üí leave your old file and comment-out the ‚ÄúStatic docs build‚Äù & peaceiris/actions-gh-pages steps in the new workflow to avoid double-publishing.

3. Do you need both Redocly and Spectral linting?

If you like Redocly‚Äôs rules, keep the ‚ÄúLint OpenAPI Spec‚Äù job (or copy that single step into the new matrix).

Otherwise you can rely solely on Spectral + openapi-diff already in spec-to-postman.yml.

Minimal-risk plan (recommended)
Rename the new file to something like .github/workflows/postman-and-docs.yml so it‚Äôs clear.

Comment out the docs build/deploy block in the new file for now:

# 6. Static docs build ...
# 7. Deploy docs ...
That way it only adds Postman & tests‚Äîno risk to your current docs flow.

Push and verify Actions tab:

You should see the new job run, generate a reports artifact with newman.html.

No collision with existing workflows.

Once you like the Postman/Tests, decide whether to:

a) migrate docs to gh-pages (delete old workflow, uncomment block 6‚Äì7), or

b) keep your old docs workflow and leave the new file handling Postman & tests only.

üß© If you eventually want one clean pipeline
Combine steps into a single YAML:

Job 1: Lint (Spectral + Redocly)

Job 2: Build Postman & run Newman/Schemathesis tests

Job 3: Build docs and deploy gh-pages

Use needs: to orchestrate (e.g., docs deploy runs only if lint passes).

But there‚Äôs no rush‚Äîseparate files are fine and safest while you iterate.

TL;DR
spec-to-postman.yml adds new functionality (Postman generation, Newman tests, optional contract testing, deploy-to-gh-pages).
It doesn‚Äôt inherently clash with your three existing workflows.
Start by running it alongside the others (comment out its docs deploy for now).
Once you confirm it works, you can retire or consolidate the older ‚Äúbuild Redoc‚Äù job to eliminate the force-push headaches.


‚úÖ Generates a Postman collection from openapi/c2m_openapi.yaml

‚úÖ Runs Newman tests against that collection (and uploads the HTML report)

‚úÖ Runs both linters

Redocly CLI (same rules you already use)

Spectral (plus the openapi-diff breaking-change check)

üö´ Does not publish to gh-pages, commit HTML, or touch your docs at all

You can either add this as a fourth workflow file or replace your existing Lint OpenAPI Spec and OpenAPI CI files with it (they‚Äôre now folded into a single ‚Äúlint‚Äù job).

How this fits with your repo
Keep / remove	Reason
Keep your current Build Redoc and Deploy workflow (or refactor later)	It still builds docs exactly the way you want. No overlap.
Delete or archive Lint OpenAPI Spec and OpenAPI CI workflows if you don‚Äôt want duplicate lints	Their functionality is fully covered in the lint job above.
Add the new file above	Gives you Postman generation + Newman without changing deploy logic.

A couple of practical notes
JWT & base URL

Replace jwtToken secret logic and baseUrl with whatever your collection expects (or swap in Postman environments).

Collection overrides (optional)

If you maintain postman/custom/overrides.json, uncomment the merge step.

Parallelization

Lint and tests are separate jobs‚Äîtests won‚Äôt run if lint fails, which saves CI minutes.

That‚Äôs it‚Äîjust commit this workflow file, push a feature branch, and watch Actions to confirm it lints, generates the collection, runs Newman, and uploads the HTML report artifact (downloadable from the UI).


üîê env: jwtToken: ${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN || 'dummy-jwt' }}
This line sets an environment variable (jwtToken) that will be available to all steps in the postman-tests job.

üîπ Purpose:
This value is passed into Newman as an environment variable during API testing. It typically represents a JWT (JSON Web Token) used to authenticate requests.

For example:


newman run collection.json \
  --env-var jwtToken=$jwtToken
If your Postman requests include a header like:


"Authorization": "Bearer {{jwtToken}}"
Newman will substitute the {{jwtToken}} variable with whatever was passed via --env-var.

‚úÖ Why use ${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN || 'dummy-jwt' }}?
This line says:

Use the GitHub secret named JWT_TOKEN, if it's set

If not, fall back to the string "dummy-jwt"

‚úÖ Benefits:
Secure in production: You can set JWT_TOKEN as a GitHub Actions Secret in your repo or org settings.

Flexible in dev/testing: If you forget to define the secret, the fallback "dummy-jwt" prevents the workflow from crashing.

üîß How to use this properly
Option 1: Provide a real token (recommended for real API tests)
Go to your GitHub repo.

Click: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

Add a new secret:

Name: JWT_TOKEN

Value: your real JWT (for example, from your staging environment)

Option 2: Use dummy-jwt
If your Postman collection works fine with a hardcoded token or doesn‚Äôt use auth during testing, the fallback "dummy-jwt" is fine.

üîê Summary
Expression	Meaning
env: jwtToken: ${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN }}	Use the secret value
`env: jwtToken: ${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN	
$jwtToken in shell commands	Uses the environment variable you just defined
{{jwtToken}} in Postman	Substituted at runtime by Newman from CLI args

Let me know if you‚Äôd prefer to load tokens from a .env file or a Postman environment file instead‚Äîboth are valid too depending on your workflow.



üîç What‚Äôs happening in spec-to-postman.yml:

# 6. Static docs build (Swagger/ReDoc)
- run: |
    mkdir -p docs
    cp openapi/c2m_openapi.yaml docs/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
    cp docs-templates/swagger.html docs/
    cp docs-templates/redoc.html   docs/
    cp docs-templates/index.html   docs/
This does not build docs using the Redoc CLI or Swagger UI generator.

It simply:

Copies your OpenAPI YAML into docs/

Copies static template files (swagger.html, redoc.html, etc.) from docs-templates/ into docs/

These HTML files are presumably pre-built single-page apps that load the spec dynamically via JavaScript (i.e., they use a url: c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml internally to load the spec).

üßæ So what's missing?
You‚Äôre not generating a static HTML file like:


redocly build-docs openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml -o docs/index.html
Or hosting Swagger UI like:


# serves Swagger UI using npm or Docker
npx swagger-ui-watcher openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
So the docs will only work if opened in a browser that can access the YAML, and your workflow is not producing standalone HTML.

‚úÖ To actually generate the ReDoc static HTML:
Add this step instead of the raw copy:


- name: Build ReDoc HTML
  run: |
    npm install -g @redocly/cli
    mkdir -p docs
    redocly build-docs openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml -o docs/index.html
‚úÖ To actually generate Swagger UI docs (optional):
You can use the Swagger CLI tool or copy a pre-configured swagger.html with embedded YAML URL.

üß© What to do now
If you're using your old workflow that does:


redocly build-docs ... -o docs/index.html
then you're fine.

If you're switching to the spec-to-postman.yml-style setup, and want to preserve actual HTML ReDoc output:

‚úÖ Replace block 6 in spec-to-postman.yml with:

- name: Install ReDoc CLI
  run: npm install -g @redocly/cli

- name: Build ReDoc HTML
  run: |
    mkdir -p docs
    redocly build-docs openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml -o docs/index.html
üö´ Omit:

cp openapi/c2m_openapi.yaml docs/
cp docs-templates/swagger.html docs/
Unless you're intentionally publishing the spec and templates directly for a JS-based viewer.

TL;DR
‚úÖ Your spec-to-postman.yml copies templates and the spec, but does not generate actual ReDoc or Swagger HTML.

üîß Add the redocly build-docs step if you want a true self-contained index.html.

‚úÖ You can safely include that build step in a job without deploying to gh-pages.


Perfect ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt need static HTML files (like index.html, swagger.html, or redoc.html), and you don‚Äôt want to deploy to gh-pages, you can safely:

‚úÖ Remove this entire section from your workflow:

# 6. Static docs build (Swagger/ReDoc)
- run: |
    mkdir -p docs
    cp openapi/c2m_openapi.yaml docs/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
    cp docs-templates/swagger.html docs/
    cp docs-templates/redoc.html   docs/
    cp docs-templates/index.html   docs/

# 7. Deploy docs to gh-pages (main only)
- if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    publish_dir: docs
üîÅ What you‚Äôre left with
Your workflow will now:

‚úÖ Run Redocly and Spectral linting

‚úÖ Run openapi-diff for breaking change detection

‚úÖ Generate a Postman collection

‚úÖ (Optionally) merge overrides

‚úÖ Run Newman tests

‚úÖ Upload the Newman HTML report

That‚Äôs a clean and focused automation pipeline‚Äîno HTML docs, no commits, no deploys.

Let me know if you want the Postman collection to also be uploaded as an artifact or pushed to a specific folder or branch.


üîß What the override merge is doing:

- run: node scripts/merge-postman.js \
       postman/generated/collection.json \
       postman/custom/overrides.json \
       > postman/generated/collection.merged.json
This takes:

The auto-generated collection (collection.json)

A user-provided file with customizations (overrides.json)

Merges them together into a new file (collection.merged.json)

‚úÖ Why use overrides?
Because OpenAPI ‚Üí Postman conversion tools don‚Äôt support everything Postman can do. Overrides let you:

Use case	What it might look like
üß™ Add tests	Inject pm.test() scripts into each request
üß† Add descriptions	Add human-readable request or folder notes
üîê Set headers or tokens	Add Authorization: Bearer {{jwtToken}} headers
üîÅ Control workflows	Add delays, pre-request scripts, chained logic
üìÇ Group requests differently	Restructure folders that Postman generator flattened or misgrouped
üí° Add environment/collection variables	e.g., baseUrl, apiKey, userId, etc.

üß± Example override (overrides.json)

{
  "info": {
    "description": "Customized collection for Click2Mail"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "Get Job Status",
      "event": [
        {
          "listen": "test",
          "script": {
            "exec": [
              "pm.test(\"Status is 200\", function () {",
              "  pm.response.to.have.status(200);",
              "});"
            ],
            "type": "text/javascript"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
This will inject a test script into the ‚ÄúGet Job Status‚Äù request after conversion.

‚ùì Do you need it?
If you‚Ä¶	Then‚Ä¶
Just want a basic Postman collection from OpenAPI	‚úÖ Skip it ‚Äî the generator output is enough
Want rich test coverage, scripted flows, or non-standard metadata in Postman	‚úÖ Keep or expand it
Don‚Äôt have a scripts/merge-postman.js file or overrides.json	üõë You‚Äôll get an error unless you remove or comment out that step

‚úÖ TL;DR
Overrides let you enhance or patch the generated Postman collection. If you're happy with the collection as-is, you can skip that step. If you want to add test scripts, headers, or change structure, then overrides.json is your hook to do it.

Let me know if you'd like a ready-to-use merge-postman.js script or a sample override file ‚Äî I can drop one in.


Yes ‚Äî everything in that workflow can be replicated (or partially replicated) on your local workstation running the Postman desktop app. Here‚Äôs how the pieces translate outside of GitHub Actions:

CI Step	Local-machine Equivalent	What you‚Äôll see in Postman
Generate collection
npx @apideck/postman-generator generate -f openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml -o postman/Click2Mail.collection.json --postman-compat	Install once:
npm install -g @apideck/postman-generator
Then run the same command from a terminal.	A *.collection.json file appears; you can Import ‚Üí File in Postman desktop.
Merge overrides
node scripts/merge-postman.js ‚Ä¶	Run the same Node script locally after generation.
If you skip this step in CI, just import the raw collection. If you keep it, run:
node scripts/merge-postman.js postman/Click2Mail.collection.json postman/custom/overrides.json > postman/Click2Mail.collection.merged.json	The merged collection will include your injected tests, descriptions, headers, etc. Import that merged file instead of the raw one.
Newman tests
newman run ‚Ä¶	Install once:
npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
Run:
newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.merged.json --env-var jwtToken=YOUR_TOKEN --env-var baseUrl=http://localhost:4000 --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export newman.html	The CLI prints test results; newman.html can be opened in a browser for a nicer view.
Environment variables (jwtToken, baseUrl)	Create or select a Postman Environment with keys jwtToken and baseUrl, or supply them via Newman CLI as above.	Requests that reference {{jwtToken}} or {{baseUrl}} will resolve correctly when you send them from the Postman UI.

Quick local workflow

# 1. Generate
npm install -g @apideck/postman-generator
openapi2postmanv2 -s openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml -o Click2Mail.json --pretty

# 2. (Optional) merge overrides
node scripts/merge-postman.js Click2Mail.json overrides.json > Click2Mail.merged.json

# 3. Import Click2Mail.merged.json into Postman desktop   OR
# 3a. Run tests with Newman
npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
newman run Click2Mail.merged.json --env-var jwtToken=MY_JWT --env-var baseUrl=http://localhost:4000
Things to remember
Same tools, same results ‚Äì The generator, merge script, and Newman behave identically whether they run in CI or on your laptop.

Postman Import ‚Äì Desktop Postman ignores Git history; it simply loads the JSON collection you point to.

Overrides are optional ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt need extra scripts or metadata, skip the merge step and import the raw collection.

Environment setup ‚Äì Define jwtToken and any other variables in Postman (or supply them via Newman) so tests don‚Äôt fail on missing tokens.

So yes‚Äîeverything will work locally; you just run the same commands manually (or wrap them in a shell script) and import the resulting collection into your installed Postman client.

what do I need to do for the postman stuff to run on github


To get the Postman generation and Newman tests working in GitHub Actions (like they do locally), you need the following 5 elements set up in your repo:

‚úÖ 1. OpenAPI spec file
Ensure your spec is in the expected location, e.g.:


openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
This is what the generator will convert into a Postman collection.

‚úÖ 2. Postman generation tool installed
The GitHub Action installs it using:


- run: npx @apideck/postman-generator generate \
         -f openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml \
         -o postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
         --postman-compat
You don‚Äôt need to do anything‚Äînpx fetches it during the workflow run.

‚úÖ 3. (Optional) Override support
Only needed if you're customizing the generated Postman collection (e.g. with test scripts, custom descriptions, etc.).

You must:

Add a file like:


postman/custom/overrides.json
And a script like:


scripts/merge-postman.js
This merge-postman.js file should take two inputs (base + override) and output merged JSON. If you don‚Äôt need this: comment out or remove the merge step in the workflow.

‚úÖ 4. JWT or auth token
Your Postman collection probably references {{jwtToken}} or similar in the headers.

Set a GitHub Actions Secret in your repo:

Go to your repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions

Click New repository secret

Name it: JWT_TOKEN

Value: your real JWT or test token (from dev or staging)

If you don't have one yet, the workflow uses a dummy fallback:


env:
  jwtToken: ${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN || 'dummy-jwt' }}
‚úÖ 5. Postman test runner (Newman)
The workflow installs and runs Newman automatically:


- run: npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html
- run: |
    mkdir -p test-reports
    newman run path/to/collection.json \
      --env-var jwtToken=$jwtToken \
      --env-var baseUrl=http://localhost:4000 \
      --reporters cli,html \
      --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
You just need to make sure:

Your API is available at the provided baseUrl (locally this might be localhost; in CI it's usually a mock, test server, or staging API)

Any required environment variables are passed

Newman can run the collection without needing interactive input

Optional: Upload HTML report for viewing
Already in the example:


- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: newman-report
    path: test-reports/newman.html
After the run, go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Workflow run ‚Üí Artifacts ‚Üí Download newman-report to see the test results.

üîÅ Summary: What you must have
Requirement	You must...
‚úÖ OpenAPI YAML	Keep it in openapi/ folder or update path in the workflow
‚úÖ Generator	Nothing to install‚Äîit‚Äôs handled via npx
üü° Overrides (optional)	Add overrides.json and merge-postman.js script ‚Äî or delete that step
‚úÖ Secret JWT token	Create GitHub Actions Secret JWT_TOKEN (or use dummy fallback)
‚úÖ Collection tests	Make sure baseUrl works in CI or adjust it; verify the collection runs

Would you like me to:

generate a working merge-postman.js script for overrides?

scaffold a minimal working repo layout with all folders (openapi/, postman/, scripts/, etc.)?

Just say the word.


Thanks ‚Äî based on the screenshot you shared, here‚Äôs how to align your Postman environment variables with your GitHub Actions workflow:

üîç You‚Äôre using these variables in Postman:
Variable	Current Value
baseUrl	http://localhost:3000
token	JWT string (starts with eyJ...)

These are likely referenced in your collection like:

http
Copy
Edit
GET {{baseUrl}}/some-endpoint
Authorization: Bearer {{token}}
‚úÖ To run Newman with the same values in GitHub Actions
Update your workflow step like this:


- name: Run Newman tests
  run: |
    mkdir -p test-reports
    newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
      --env-var baseUrl=http://localhost:3000 \
      --env-var token=${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN }} \
      --reporters cli,html \
      --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
üîê Set JWT_TOKEN secret in GitHub
Go to:
Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret

Name: JWT_TOKEN

Value: Paste the same JWT token from your Postman environment (eyJ...)

üü° Optional: Postman environment file
If you want to avoid setting CLI flags and prefer to use an exported Postman environment file:

In Postman desktop:

Click your environment ‚Üí Export ‚Üí Save as postman.environment.json

Commit it (or store in .github/postman_envs/)

Change your workflow to:


- run: newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
         -e .github/postman_envs/postman.environment.json \
         --reporters cli,html \
         --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
‚úÖ Summary: You‚Äôre almost there
Task	Done?
Using Postman with baseUrl and token	‚úÖ
Matching token ‚Üí GitHub Action via secrets.JWT_TOKEN	üîú Set this
Referencing both via --env-var in Newman	‚úÖ or use .json env
Running Newman test step in CI	‚úÖ Workflow-ready

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help exporting the .postman_environment.json or writing a helper script to sync the values automatically.



Great follow-up. You have two options for setting the baseUrl when running Newman in GitHub Actions, depending on how you want to manage it:

‚úÖ Option 1: Hardcode it in the workflow (most common for CI)
If your tests always hit the same base URL in CI (e.g. https://api.staging.example.com or http://localhost:4000), you can just set it directly in the workflow:


- name: Run Newman tests
  run: |
    newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
      --env-var baseUrl=https://api.staging.example.com \
      --env-var token=${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN }} \
      --reporters cli,html \
      --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
No secret needed for baseUrl unless it contains sensitive info (it usually doesn't).

‚úÖ Option 2: Set it as a GitHub Actions secret or variable
If you want to keep baseUrl configurable and avoid hardcoding:

üîí Option A ‚Äî Use a secret
Go to Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions

Click New repository secret

Name: BASE_URL
Value: https://api.staging.example.com (or whatever your CI target is)

Then in your workflow:


--env-var baseUrl=${{ secrets.BASE_URL }}
‚öôÔ∏è Option B ‚Äî Use a plain environment variable
This is slightly less secure (visible to other workflows in the repo), but easier if no secrets are involved.

Go to Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Variables

Add a variable:

Name: BASE_URL

Value: http://localhost:3000 or whatever target your API tests run against

Then reference it:


--env-var baseUrl=${{ vars.BASE_URL }}
üí° Use secrets. for sensitive values (like tokens), and vars. for config values (like base URLs, ports, modes, etc.)

üü® Optional: Use a Postman environment file
If you're using baseUrl in a Postman environment locally and want to re-use that:

Export the environment from Postman desktop

Save it to your repo, e.g., postman/environment.ci.json

In the workflow:


- run: newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
         -e postman/environment.ci.json \
         --reporters cli,html \
         --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
This avoids managing variables manually via --env-var.

‚úÖ Summary
You want to...	Best approach
Hardcode baseUrl for CI	Use --env-var baseUrl=https://your.api
Keep baseUrl flexible and secure	Use secrets.BASE_URL
Reuse what you already have in Postman	Export a Postman environment file and reference it with -e

Let me know which direction you prefer, and I can adjust the full workflow accordingly.


Totally fair ‚Äî this is a common point of confusion, because Postman itself is not accessed directly from GitHub Actions. Here's a clear breakdown to explain exactly what's going on:

üö´ GitHub Actions does not connect to Postman Cloud or Desktop
It does not call the Postman API.

It does not open your Postman app.

It does not "run" anything inside Postman itself.

‚úÖ Instead, GitHub Actions runs Newman, the CLI version of Postman
Newman is a command-line tool created by Postman that allows you to:

Run Postman collections without Postman Desktop

Pass in variables like baseUrl or token

Generate CLI and HTML test reports

Use the same collection JSON that Postman exports/imports

‚ûï Bonus: Newman is open-source and CI-friendly
You can install it anywhere (like GitHub Actions), and it runs completely independently.

üß≠ The flow in GitHub Actions looks like this:
‚úÖ Generate Postman collection from your OpenAPI spec using a tool like @apideck/postman-generator.

This produces a .collection.json file ‚Äî same format you'd import/export in Postman Desktop.

‚úÖ Pass that collection into Newman, like this:


newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
  --env-var baseUrl=https://api.example.com \
  --env-var token=${{ secrets.JWT_TOKEN }} \
  --reporters cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman.html
‚úÖ Newman executes every request in the collection ‚Äî just like Postman would ‚Äî using the provided variables.

‚úÖ The test results and HTML report are uploaded as artifacts in GitHub so you can download and review them.

üîÑ Summary: What's doing what?
What	Purpose	Location
Postman (Desktop or Cloud)	UI to build, edit, and test your API collections	Your local machine
Collection JSON file	Portable spec for Newman to run	Stored in your repo or generated in CI
Newman	CLI runner that executes Postman collections	Installed in GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions	Automates generation, testing, and validation	Your CI pipeline

ü§î So how does your Postman work "connect" to GitHub?
You make it work by exporting or generating a .collection.json (and optionally a .environment.json) file, and Newman uses those files to simulate running your collection in Postman ‚Äî completely within GitHub Actions.

‚úÖ TL;DR
GitHub never accesses your Postman account or app. Instead, it runs your Postman collection using Newman, which behaves like a headless version of Postman inside CI.

Let me know if you'd like:

A working example repo with this set up

A script that syncs your Postman collection into GitHub

Help exporting and cleaning up the collection or environment JSON files


Not quite. Newman does not create or run a Postman mock server.
Instead, Newman is simply a collection runner‚Äîit executes the HTTP requests already defined in your Postman collection, targeting whatever URL you give it.

üîë Key distinctions
Thing	What it actually does
Postman mock server	A hosted endpoint (e.g., https://<hash>.mock.pstmn.io) generated in Postman Cloud that returns sample responses you‚Äôve saved.
Newman	A command-line tool that sends the requests in your collection to whichever {{baseUrl}} (or full URL) the collection specifies, then checks any test scripts.

How they can work together
Create a Postman mock server in the Postman UI. Postman gives you a base URL like:


https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
In your collection (or in an environment file) set:


baseUrl = https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
Commit or export that collection/environment JSON to your repo (or generate it in CI).

Run Newman in GitHub Actions:


newman run Click2Mail.collection.json \
  --env-var baseUrl=https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
Now Newman‚Äôs requests hit the Postman-hosted mock server, get the canned responses, and execute your tests‚Äîgreat for CI when you don‚Äôt have a live API.

If you don‚Äôt want to rely on Postman Cloud mocks
Standalone mock servers: Tools like Prism can serve mock responses from your OpenAPI spec. You‚Äôd launch Prism in a separate CI step (e.g., prism mock openapi.yaml) and point Newman‚Äôs baseUrl to http://localhost:4010.

Spin up your real service in Docker or whichever stack you use, then point Newman to http://localhost:3000 (common in end-to-end tests).

TL;DR
Newman = runner (fires requests, checks tests).

Postman mock server = endpoint (returns stubbed responses).

Newman can target a Postman mock server, but it doesn‚Äôt create or host one itself‚Äîyou supply the mock URL (or any other URL) via environment variables or your collection.


To get Newman to target a Postman mock server, all you need to do is point it to the mock server's base URL using a variable (typically baseUrl) in your Postman collection or environment file.

Here‚Äôs a full walkthrough:

‚úÖ Step 1: Create a Postman Mock Server
In Postman, go to your collection.

Click the three-dot menu ‚Üí Mock Collection.

Choose:

Environment (if needed)

Name the mock server

Choose "Save example responses"

Postman gives you a mock server URL, e.g.:


https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
‚úÖ Step 2: Reference {{baseUrl}} in your collection
Make sure your request URLs look like this in your Postman collection:


GET {{baseUrl}}/your-endpoint
This allows you to inject the base URL via environment variables in Newman or Postman.

‚úÖ Step 3: Use Newman to run the collection against the mock server
Option A: Pass the baseUrl directly

newman run path/to/collection.json \
  --env-var baseUrl=https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
Newman will:

Replace {{baseUrl}} in your requests

Send the requests to the mock server

Receive the canned example responses

Run your pm.test() assertions on those responses

Option B: Use a Postman environment file
If you have an environment file (JSON) with:


{
  "values": [
    {
      "key": "baseUrl",
      "value": "https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "name": "MockEnv",
  "timestamp": 0
}
Then run:


newman run path/to/collection.json \
  -e path/to/MockEnv.postman_environment.json
‚úÖ Step 4: Optional ‚Äì Test with real pm.test() scripts
In your Postman collection, you can define tests like:

javascript
Copy
Edit
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response contains mock message", function () {
  var jsonData = pm.response.json();
  pm.expect(jsonData.message).to.eql("This is a mock response");
});
These will run in Newman even though the data is fake ‚Äî it‚Äôs just verifying your expected format.

üîÅ Summary
What you need	How
Mock server URL	Created in Postman UI
Requests in collection	Use {{baseUrl}}/...
Newman CLI	Run with --env-var baseUrl=https://... or use a Postman environment file

Let me know if you want:

A template collection that targets a Postman mock server

Help exporting your current collection + mock into a GitHub Actions‚Äìfriendly setup


Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs both:

‚úÖ 1. Template Postman Collection that Targets a Mock Server
You can import this into Postman or save it directly in your GitHub repo (e.g., postman/mock-test.collection.json):

üì¶ mock-test.collection.json

{
  "info": {
    "name": "Mock Server Example",
    "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "GET /hello",
      "request": {
        "method": "GET",
        "header": [
          {
            "key": "Authorization",
            "value": "Bearer {{token}}",
            "type": "text"
          }
        ],
        "url": {
          "raw": "{{baseUrl}}/hello",
          "host": ["{{baseUrl}}"],
          "path": ["hello"]
        }
      },
      "response": []
    }
  ],
  "event": [
    {
      "listen": "test",
      "script": {
        "exec": [
          "pm.test(\"Status code is 200\", function () {",
          "    pm.response.to.have.status(200);",
          "});",
          "",
          "pm.test(\"Contains greeting\", function () {",
          "    var jsonData = pm.response.json();",
          "    pm.expect(jsonData.message).to.include(\"Hello\");",
          "});"
        ],
        "type": "text/javascript"
      }
    }
  ]
}
This collection expects:

A {{baseUrl}} (e.g., Postman mock URL)

A {{token}} for authorization header (can be dummy if not used)

‚úÖ 2. Postman Environment File for the Mock Server
Save this as postman/mock-env.json or similar:

üåê mock-env.json

{
  "id": "mock-env",
  "name": "Mock Server Environment",
  "values": [
    {
      "key": "baseUrl",
      "value": "https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "key": "token",
      "value": "mock-token-value",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "_postman_variable_scope": "environment",
  "_postman_exported_at": "2025-07-12T00:00:00.000Z",
  "_postman_exported_using": "Postman/10.x"
}
Replace the baseUrl with your actual mock server URL from Postman.

‚úÖ 3. Newman CLI Usage
Once both files are in your repo (or locally), run:


newman run postman/mock-test.collection.json \
  -e postman/mock-env.json \
  --reporters cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export newman-report.html
You‚Äôll get:

CLI output showing test passes/fails

newman-report.html file you can open in your browser or upload in GitHub Actions

‚úÖ 4. GitHub Actions Workflow Snippet
Here‚Äôs the test step you‚Äôd drop into your .github/workflows/postman-tests.yml:


- name: Install Newman
  run: npm install -g newman newman-reporter-html

- name: Run Postman Collection against Mock Server
  run: |
    mkdir -p test-reports
    newman run postman/mock-test.collection.json \
      -e postman/mock-env.json \
      --reporters cli,html \
      --reporter-html-export test-reports/newman-report.html

- name: Upload Newman Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: newman-mock-report
    path: test-reports/newman-report.html



‚úÖ Final Summary
File	Purpose
mock-test.collection.json	Example Postman collection that uses {{baseUrl}} and {{token}}
mock-env.json	Postman environment file that sets your mock server base URL and token
GitHub Actions step	Runs tests using Newman against that mock URL

Would you like me to bundle these into a .zip for quick download or paste them into a public GitHub Gist for import?



Great ‚Äî here‚Äôs how to run everything we‚Äôve discussed (Postman collection generation, mock environment, Newman tests, etc.) entirely on your local machine ‚Äî no GitHub Actions needed.

üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Do Locally
You‚Äôll:

Install necessary tools

Generate a Postman collection from your OpenAPI spec

(Optionally) merge overrides

Run tests against a Postman mock server using Newman

View results in the terminal and HTML

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Run Everything Locally
1. üîß Install Required Tools (once)
Install these globally (or use npx per run):


npm install -g @apideck/postman-generator newman newman-reporter-html
If you‚Äôre using a custom override script:


# If using the custom script (optional):
npm install -g lodash
2. üìÑ Create Directory Structure (if not done)


project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ openapi/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ postman/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ merge-postman.js         # optional
3. üß™ Generate Postman Collection


npx @apideck/postman-generator generate \
  -f openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml \
  -o postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
  --postman-compat
4. (Optional) üß¨ Merge Overrides
If you have overrides:

node scripts/merge-postman.js \
  postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
  postman/overrides.json \
  > postman/Click2Mail.collection.merged.json
Otherwise, just use the raw collection file (Click2Mail.collection.json).

5. üß™ Run Tests Using Newman Against Postman Mock Server
Make sure mock-env.json looks like this:

{
  "values": [
    { "key": "baseUrl", "value": "https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io", "enabled": true },
    { "key": "token", "value": "mock-jwt-token", "enabled": true }
  ],
  "name": "Mock Server Environment"
}
Then run:

newman run postman/Click2Mail.collection.json \
  -e postman/mock-env.json \
  --reporters cli,html \
  --reporter-html-export newman-report.html
Replace the filename with Click2Mail.collection.merged.json if you merged.

6. üìÇ View Results
‚úÖ Terminal output will show test results

‚úÖ Open newman-report.html in your browser to see a full visual test report

‚úÖ Optional Local Mock Server (if not using Postman mock server)
If you prefer not to use Postman's mock server:

Install Prism:

npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
Run Prism from your spec:

prism mock openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
Change baseUrl in your env file to:

http://localhost:4010
Re-run Newman.

openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml	Minimal placeholder OpenAPI 3.0 spec (replace with your real spec).
postman/Click2Mail.collection.json	Example collection using {{baseUrl}}/hello.
postman/mock-env.json	Environment file pre-filled with a sample Postman mock-server URL & token.
postman/overrides.json	Demonstrates adding a test script via override.
scripts/merge-postman.js	Simple Node script that deep-merges the override into the generated collection.
README.md	Step-by-step local run instructions (same as described earlier).

Download and unzip, then follow the README:

Your starter bundle is ready!

üëâ Download the complete Postman + Newman local runner kit

It includes:

OpenAPI spec

Sample Postman collection

Mock environment file

Optional override JSON

Merge script (merge-postman.js)

A full step-by-step README.md

Let me know if you want me to help wire this into a GitHub Actions workflow too. 


Absolutely. A Makefile is a great way to wrap the exact local steps into easy one-liners.

Below is a minimal Makefile that reproduces everything in the starter kit:

# ---------- CONFIG ------------------------------------
OPENAPI   := openapi/c2m_openapi_spec_final.yaml
COLL_RAW  := postman/Click2Mail.collection.json
COLL_MERGED := postman/Click2Mail.collection.merged.json
OVERRIDE  := postman/overrides.json
ENV_FILE  := postman/mock-env.json
REPORT    := newman-report.html

# Tools (override at CLI if needed, e.g. `make NEWMAN="npx newman"` )
GENERATOR := npx @apideck/postman-generator
NEWMAN    := npx newman
MERGER    := node scripts/merge-postman.js

# ---------- TARGETS -----------------------------------

.PHONY: all install generate merge test clean

## Default: generate + merge + test
all: generate merge test

## Install global CLI deps (skip if you already have them)
install:
	npm install -g @apideck/postman-generator newman newman-reporter-html lodash

## Generate collection from OpenAPI
generate: $(COLL_RAW)

$(COLL_RAW): $(OPENAPI)
	$(GENERATOR) generate -f $(OPENAPI) -o $(COLL_RAW) --postman-compat
	@echo "‚úÖ Generated $(COLL_RAW)"

## Merge overrides into collection
merge: $(COLL_MERGED)

$(COLL_MERGED): $(COLL_RAW) $(OVERRIDE)
	$(MERGER) $(COLL_RAW) $(OVERRIDE) > $(COLL_MERGED)
	@echo "‚úÖ Merged overrides ‚Üí $(COLL_MERGED)"

## Run Newman tests against mock server
test: $(COLL_MERGED)
	$(NEWMAN) run $(COLL_MERGED) -e $(ENV_FILE) \
	  --reporters cli,html \
	  --reporter-html-export $(REPORT)
	@echo "‚úÖ Newman tests complete ‚Äì see $(REPORT)"

## Clean generated artifacts
clean:
	rm -f $(COLL_RAW) $(COLL_MERGED) $(REPORT)

How to use

# 1) Install CLIs once (optional if already installed)
make install

# 2) Generate collection, merge overrides, run Newman tests
make            # or: make all

# 3) Run only a specific step
make generate   # just regenerate collection
make merge      # re-merge overrides
make test       # rerun Newman using latest collection

# 4) Remove outputs
make clean
Notes & Tweaks
No overrides?
Delete the merge target and point test directly at $(COLL_RAW).

Real API vs. mock server:
Swap ENV_FILE to a different environment JSON, or inject --env-var flags inside the NEWMAN command.

Tool versions:
If you prefer global installs, run make install once and edit GENERATOR / NEWMAN to postman-generator / newman.

This lets you run the full Postman ‚Üí Newman workflow with simple make commands, and it dovetails nicely with CI: just call make test from GitHub Actions instead of re-writing the individual shell steps.



You said:
when running newman in such a way that i conncects to a postman mock server on github, how do I setup the postman mock server from github


ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî and it's a subtle distinction.

üîë Short answer: You cannot create or configure a Postman mock server directly from GitHub (e.g. via GitHub Actions or a Makefile) unless you use the Postman API and authenticate with a Postman API key.

üîß What you can do:
‚úÖ 1. Create the mock server in Postman manually
This is the normal workflow:

Open the Postman app or web.

Select your collection ‚Üí click the three dots ‚Üí "Mock Collection"

Choose "Save example responses" for each endpoint

Postman creates a mock server like:

https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
You use this URL in your environment file or --env-var baseUrl=...

You then commit the collection and environment JSON to GitHub. Your GitHub Actions job or Makefile can now run Newman tests against the mock.

üß∞ What you‚Äôd need to automate mock server creation from GitHub:
üõ†Ô∏è Option: Use the Postman API (advanced, and rarely necessary)
Postman offers a REST API that lets you:

Upload a collection

Create a mock server from a collection

Get the mock server URL

üîê You‚Äôll need:
A Postman API key (from your Postman profile settings)

A workspace ID

Collection ID (or create/upload one)

üîÅ Example flow:
Upload your collection using:

arduino
Copy
Edit
POST https://api.getpostman.com/collections
Authorization: X-Api-Key: {{postman_api_key}}
Create a mock:


POST https://api.getpostman.com/mocks
Body:
{
  "mock": {
    "collection": "{{collection_uid}}",
    "environment": "{{env_uid}}",
    "name": "CI-generated mock",
    "private": false
  }
}
Parse the returned mock URL and pass it into Newman.

‚ö†Ô∏è Gotchas
You must store your Postman API key as a GitHub Actions secret.

The Postman API only works for public or team-based Postman workspaces.

This is overkill for most use cases ‚Äî especially if you only need a stable mock server URL.

‚úÖ Recommended Simpler Setup
Manually create the mock server in Postman once.

Use the URL like:

https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
Store this URL in:

A Postman environment file (mock-env.json) committed to your repo

Or a GitHub Actions secret or Makefile variable

Pass --env-var baseUrl=https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io to Newman

This works consistently and is CI-safe.

TL;DR
Goal	Approach
‚úÖ Use Postman mock server in GitHub or Makefile	Create it manually in Postman, store the mock URL, and use it in your tests
‚öôÔ∏è Automate mock server creation	Use Postman API with an API key, but it‚Äôs more complex and rarely needed

Would you like a sample GitHub Actions workflow that uses the Postman API to auto-create a mock server as a learning example?



Yes ‚Äî a Postman Mock-Server URL is a public HTTPS endpoint
When you click ‚ÄúMock Collection‚Äù in Postman, the platform spins up a server for you and returns a URL that looks like

https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io   ‚üµ public internet address
Key points:

Fact	Details
Protocol	Always HTTPS (port 443).
Reachability	Anyone on the internet can hit that URL as long as they know it. No VPN or tunnel is required.
Rate limit	Free tier ‚âà 1000 calls / month per mock; paid tiers higher.
Auth	By default the mock is open. You can add an API key header if you toggle ‚ÄúPrivate Mock‚Äù during creation‚Äîthen requests must include
X-Mock-API-Key: <key>
Data returned	Only the example responses you saved in the collection. If no example matches, the mock returns 404 or a generic sample schema.
CORS	Enabled; useful for front-end work.
Lifetime	Persists until you delete the mock or delete the underlying collection.

How this fits your CI / Makefile flow
Create the mock once in Postman ‚Üí note the URL (and API-key if private).

Commit that URL in your Postman environment file or store it in a GitHub secret / Makefile variable, e.g.



# Makefile
BASE_URL = https://12345678.mock.pstmn.io
Run Newman with:

newman run collection.json --env-var baseUrl=$(BASE_URL)
Because the mock server is publicly reachable, Newman running inside GitHub Actions (or any local terminal) can call it without extra networking setup.

Let me know if you need:

Below is a Mermaid flow-chart that captures the CI pipeline we just put together for GitHub Actions (lint ‚Üí collection ‚Üí override ‚Üí Newman ‚Üí report). You can paste this directly into a Markdown file (e.g., docs/workflow.md) or view it live in VS Code, GitHub, or any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid.
