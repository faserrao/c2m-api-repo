## Documentation Philosophy

The updated documentation follows these principles:

1. **Timeless**: Focuses on how systems work, not current values
2. **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of each system
3. **Practical**: Includes patterns and best practices
4. **Maintainable**: Easier to keep current without constant updates
5. **Educational**: Teaches concepts, not just procedures

## Archive Structure

Original documentation preserved in:
- `/user-guides/archive/` - Contains original versions for reference
- No modifications to archived files
- Maintains historical context

## Impact

These changes provide:
- Better understanding of system architecture
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Improved onboarding for new developers
- Clear separation between design and implementation
- Foundation for future documentation efforts

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly documentation reviews
2. **Version Control**: Track major system changes in docs
3. **Feedback Loop**: Gather user feedback on documentation
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update based on common questions
5. **Training Materials**: Use these guides as basis for training
