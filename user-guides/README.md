# C2M API V2 User Guides

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for understanding and working with the C2M API v2 build system and infrastructure.

## üìö Documentation Overview

### Core Documentation

#### [BUILD_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md](./BUILD_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE.md)
The complete technical reference for the C2M API v2 build system. This guide explains:
- How the build pipeline transforms EBNF to a complete API ecosystem
- All Makefile targets and their purposes
- GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- Dynamic resource management for Postman
- Test generation and execution
- Documentation and SDK generation processes

### Additional Guides

#### Security Setup
- **SECURITY_REPO_GITHUB_SETUP.md** - Instructions for configuring the security repository integration

#### File Inspection Tools
- **finspect-README.md** - Documentation for the file inspection utility
- **finspect-file-type-detection-methods.md** - Technical details on file type detection

## üöÄ Getting Started

For developers new to the C2M API v2 build system:

1. **Read the BUILD_INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDE** to understand the complete system
2. **Run `make check-env`** to verify your local setup
3. **Execute `make pipeline`** to run the complete build
4. **Check generated artifacts** in `dist/`, `docs/`, and `postman/` directories

## üîß Key Concepts

### Build Pipeline
The system follows a linear transformation pipeline:
```
EBNF ‚Üí OpenAPI ‚Üí Postman ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Docs/SDKs
```

### Dynamic Resources
All Postman collections, mock servers, and environments are created dynamically during the build process. The system tracks these using UID files that persist between builds.

### Environment Agnostic
The same Makefile targets work both locally and in CI/CD, with appropriate adaptations for each environment.
