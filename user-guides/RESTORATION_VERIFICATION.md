# C2M API Restoration Verification Report

## Date: September 7, 2025

## Summary
The restoration of the c2m-api-repo to its pre-auth state appears to be **SUCCESSFUL**.

## Verification Results

### 1. Pipeline Test Results ✅
- **npm dependencies**: Installed successfully (though needed manual `npm install`)
- **OpenAPI generation**: Working (lint passed with only warnings)
- **Postman collection generation**: Working
- **Mock server creation**: Working (both Prism and Postman)
- **Test execution**: 22/24 tests passing (2 failures due to expected status codes)

### 2. Makefile Status ✅
- **No redundant auth targets found**
- **No references to security repo found**
- **Original structure preserved**
- All core targets functioning properly

### 3. Directory Structure ✅
All required directories present:
- ✅ postman/
- ✅ postman/custom/
- ✅ postman/generated/
- ✅ openapi/
- ✅ openapi/overlays/
- ✅ docs/
- ✅ data_dictionary/
- ✅ scripts/

### 4. Key Scripts ✅
All critical scripts present and accessible:
- ✅ scripts/active/add_tests.js
- ✅ scripts/active/ebnf_to_openapi_dynamic_v3.py
- ✅ scripts/jq/fix_paths.jq
- ✅ scripts/jq/merge.jq
- ✅ scripts/test_data_generator_for_collections/addRandomDataToRaw.js

### 5. Auth Code Verification ✅
- **No auth-specific code found in main repo**
- **No references to cognito or JWT providers**
- **No security repo dependencies**

## Minor Issues Found

1. **Test Status Codes**: Tests expect [200,400,401] but some endpoints return 201, 204, 404, or 429
   - This is a test configuration issue, not a restoration problem
   - Can be fixed by updating POSTMAN_ALLOWED_CODES in Makefile

2. **Dependency Installation**: The `postman-instance-build-and-test` target doesn't automatically install dependencies
   - Recommendation: Consider adding dependency checks to main targets
   - The `rebuild-all-with-delete` target likely handles this better

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate use**: The repo is ready to use in its current state
2. **For auth integration**: Apply the minimal-auth-patch.diff when ready
3. **For testing**: Update allowed status codes to include: 201,204,404,429
4. **For CI/CD**: Ensure dependency installation is part of the pipeline

## Conclusion

The restoration successfully returned the c2m-api-repo to its clean Aug 30, 2024 state. All bloated auth code has been removed, redundant Makefile targets eliminated, and the original functionality preserved. The repo is ready for clean, minimal auth integration when needed.
