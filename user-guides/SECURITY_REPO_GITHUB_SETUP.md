# Security Repository GitHub Setup - IMPORTANT ACTION REQUIRED

## What Was Done While You Were Sleeping

1. **Initialized the security repo as a Git repository**
   - Created proper .gitignore file
   - Made initial commit with all files

2. **Created GitHub repository**
   - Repository: https://github.com/faserrao/c2m-api-v2-security
   - Set as private repository
   - Pushed all code successfully

3. **Updated CI/CD workflow**
   - Modified `.github/workflows/api-ci-cd.yml` to checkout security repo
   - Configured to use `SECURITY_REPO_TOKEN` for authentication

## ACTION REQUIRED: Add Your Existing PAT to Repository Secrets

Since the security repo is private, you need to add your existing Personal Access Token (PAT) to the repository secrets for the CI/CD workflow to access it.

### Step 1: Use Your Existing PAT
You already have a PAT configured (the one you use with Claude Code to access GitHub). You'll use this same token.

### Step 2: Add PAT to Main Repo Secrets
1. Go to https://github.com/faserrao/c2m-api-repo/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `SECURITY_REPO_TOKEN`
4. Secret: Paste the PAT you copied
5. Click "Add secret"

### Step 3: Test the Workflow
1. Make a small change to trigger the workflow (e.g., add a comment to Makefile)
2. Commit and push
3. Check Actions tab to ensure the security repo checkout succeeds

## What This Fixes

With the security repo now on GitHub and accessible in CI:
- The `postman-auth-setup` target will find the JWT auth provider script
- Auth scripts will be properly added to test collections in CI
- The flexibility to switch auth providers (e.g., CloudFlare) is maintained

## Security Notes

- The security repo is private
- PAT access is limited to just reading the repo
- The PAT should be rotated periodically
- Consider using GitHub's new fine-grained PATs for even more restricted access

## Alternative: Make Security Repo Public

If you prefer not to manage PATs, you could make the security repo public:
```bash
gh repo edit faserrao/c2m-api-v2-security --visibility public
```

Then change the workflow back to use `GITHUB_TOKEN`:
```yaml
token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

However, keeping it private is recommended for security components.
