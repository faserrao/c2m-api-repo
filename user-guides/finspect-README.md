# Finspect - Financial Document Inspection Utilities

## Overview

Finspect is a collection of utilities designed for inspecting and validating financial documents within the C2M API v2 system. These utilities help ensure document integrity and compliance before processing through the mail API.

## Purpose

The Finspect utilities serve several key functions:

1. **Document Validation**: Verify financial documents meet required standards
2. **Format Detection**: Automatically identify document types and formats
3. **Content Extraction**: Extract key financial data for processing
4. **Compliance Checking**: Ensure documents meet regulatory requirements

## Integration with C2M API

Finspect utilities integrate with the C2M API build system:

- Used during document upload validation
- Provides metadata for API responses
- Supports pre-processing for mail merge operations
- Enhances error reporting for invalid documents

## File Type Detection

The system includes sophisticated file type detection methods documented in [finspect-file-type-detection-methods.md](./finspect-file-type-detection-methods.md).

## Usage

Finspect utilities are automatically invoked by the C2M API when:
- Documents are uploaded through API endpoints
- Batch processing includes financial documents
- Validation is required before mail processing
