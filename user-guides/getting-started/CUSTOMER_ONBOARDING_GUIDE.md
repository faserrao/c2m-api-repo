## Overview

The C2M API V2 customer onboarding process is designed to ensure secure, scalable, and successful API integration. Each customer receives a fully isolated environment with customized configurations based on their subscription tier.

### Onboarding Principles

1. **Security First**: Credentials are generated securely and delivered through encrypted channels
2. **Isolation**: Complete separation between customer environments
3. **Scalability**: Resources allocated based on subscription tier
4. **Support**: Guided onboarding with technical assistance

### Subscription Tiers

The system supports multiple subscription tiers:
- **Basic**: Entry-level access with standard rate limits
- **Premium**: Enhanced limits and staging environment
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited access with dedicated support

---

## Onboarding Process

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

The onboarding process begins when a customer signs a contract:

1. **Contract Execution**
   - Sales team finalizes agreement
   - Technical requirements documented
   - Subscription tier determined

2. **Account Provisioning**
   - Customer ID generated
   - Infrastructure allocated
   - Security policies applied

3. **Credential Generation**
   - Unique client credentials created
   - Environment-specific keys generated
   - Secure delivery prepared

### Phase 2: Technical Onboarding

Technical onboarding ensures successful integration:

1. **Welcome Package**
   - Secure credential delivery
   - Documentation access
   - Quick start guides

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Development environment ready
   - Testing resources allocated
   - Monitoring configured

3. **Initial Validation**
   - Credential testing
   - API connectivity verification
   - Support channel confirmation

### Phase 3: Integration Support

Ongoing support during integration:

1. **Technical Assistance**
   - Architecture review
   - Best practices guidance
   - Code examples

2. **Testing Support**
   - Test data provisioning
   - Mock server access
   - Validation tools

3. **Go-Live Preparation**
   - Production readiness review
   - Performance testing
   - Cutover planning

## Account Architecture

### Customer Isolation

Each customer receives:
- **Unique namespace**: Prevents cross-customer access
- **Dedicated credentials**: Customer-specific authentication
- **Resource quotas**: Based on subscription tier
- **Audit trails**: Complete activity logging

### Multi-Environment Strategy

Customers can access multiple environments:

```
Production Environment
├── Full rate limits
├── Real processing
└── Production SLAs

Staging Environment (Premium+)
├── Production mirror
├── Test processing
└── Load testing allowed

Development Environment
├── Limited rate limits
├── Simulated processing
└── Enhanced debugging
```

### Security Architecture

Security layers include:
- **Credential encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **Network isolation**: VPC-based separation
- **Access controls**: Role-based permissions
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive tracking

---

## Authentication System

### Two-Token Architecture

The authentication system uses a two-token approach:

1. **Long-term Tokens**
   - Used for authentication only
   - Never sent to API endpoints
   - Configurable lifetime (30-90 days)

2. **Short-term Tokens**
   - Used for API calls
   - Auto-refreshed as needed
   - Fixed 15-minute lifetime

### Token Management Flow

```
Client Credentials
       ↓
Long-term Token (stored securely)
       ↓
Short-term Token (auto-refreshed)
       ↓
API Calls
```

### Security Features

- **Token isolation**: Different tokens for different purposes
- **Automatic refresh**: No manual intervention needed
- **Revocation support**: Immediate invalidation possible
- **Scope management**: Granular permissions

---
