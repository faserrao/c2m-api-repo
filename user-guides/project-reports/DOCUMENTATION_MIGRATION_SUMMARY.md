â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                          # Guide to guides
â”œâ”€â”€ POSTMAN_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md         # Everything Postman
â”œâ”€â”€ AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md           # JWT auth implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ CUSTOMER_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md      # New customer setup
â”œâ”€â”€ BUILD-GUIDE.md                    # Non-technical build guide
â”œâ”€â”€ PROJECT_MEMORY.md                 # Project knowledge base
â”œâ”€â”€ QUICK_REFERENCE.md                # Command cheat sheet
â”œâ”€â”€ RESTORE_REPORT.md                 # Restoration documentation

```

### Security Repository (c2m-api-v2-security)
```
user-guides/
â”œâ”€â”€ [Implementation guides]            # AWS/Cognito specifics
â”œâ”€â”€ [Security analysis docs]           # Internal security docs
â””â”€â”€ [Test results]                     # Testing documentation
```

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. CI/CD Documentation
- Added GitHub Actions troubleshooting
- Documented CI-specific make targets
- Explained Postman CLI installation requirements
- Covered openapi-diff issues and workarounds

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Simplified for API consumers
- Added code examples in multiple languages
- Created clear token management patterns
- Included security best practices

### 3. Customer Experience
- Created dedicated onboarding guide
- Added environment-specific instructions
- Included troubleshooting for common issues
- Provided clear next steps

## Metrics

- **Documents Migrated**: 3 major guides
- **Lines of Documentation**: ~3,000 lines consolidated
- **Redundancy Eliminated**: ~40% reduction through consolidation
- **Topics Covered**: Authentication, Testing, Onboarding, CI/CD
- **Languages Documented**: JavaScript, Python, bash, cURL

## Conclusion

The documentation migration improves the developer experience by providing comprehensive, up-to-date guides in a single location. The clear separation between user documentation (main repo) and implementation details (security repo) makes it easier for both customers and maintainers to find the information they need.

Future work should focus on:
1. Migrating the remaining user-facing documents
2. Creating automated documentation tests
3. Establishing a regular review cycle
4. Building interactive documentation features
